<p>In this post I would like to introduce you to the latest language from python programming, we name it pandas. But before that, let us look at how it can be used for various things.</p>



<p>Pandas is a data manipulation package, specially designed for large-scale numerical data analysis and visualization. It was developed in 2009 by Wes McKinney and his graduate student Julia Sidel and was initially based on R. Pandas has been very beneficial for many different fields of research—from scientific computing to financial finance to machine learning. The primary advantage of using pandas is that it allows users to operate with huge amounts of data without having to worry about memory or storage space. Let’s start our discussion by using pandas for beginners and then move on moving forward.</p>



<p>Pandas help read and write to a few files, which are table-like lists and dictionaries. For example, we can use pandas to read the following file named ‘test.csv’. You need to import pandas after reading the CSV file. So first I will do this firstly, but not only that you need to use this code later, but you also need to import certain packages as well.</p>



<p>The second code is importing ‘NumPy’. Now if you don’t know what is numpy and why we need to import it then follow my article on what is Numpy &amp; How Can We Use It. A brief introduction to numpy and other essential libraries used in the field of Machine Learning.</p>



<p>Now we will try to understand some data that is stored in this CSV file. First, let us create two datasets using pandas.</p>



<p>Let us call the test.csv dataset the x_train dataset and y_train dataset.</p>



<p>The x_train dataset contains an array called features. Features are a list of two columns, we can see these two variables in the x_train file. Our goal here is to get details of the variables and make them independent. Let’s create another CSV file named training.csv.</p>



<p>Now let us create the training CSV file.</p>



<p>Now we will print the entire feature column names and their values in train.csv.</p>



<p>What do we observe from these two files? The variable ‘x’ is the original one, and the second one is the target variable; so it is not something random. I already have done all the above steps, but we still can change the values and make them dependent variables. If you want to know more about dependent and independent variables then check this great article from Stack Overflow. Here we are considering both kinds of variables.</p>



<p>Let us write a script to write down the value of the target and then use it to calculate the score given by X and y. Then the score can be displayed as output in a text box. I will show you below the code I did.</p>



<p>This script should give us the output:</p>



<p>That’s it!</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s execute the above codes in the terminal. Remember this is the last step in coding. We have to run the code in the terminal. Do you see any errors here? Yes, no errors.</p>



<p>Now let us execute these codes from the command line.</p>



<p>We get the same result as we saw earlier.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<h1 class="has-small-font-size">Pandas is a very useful library for analyzing data. There are many tutorials on where to find information for different types of problems to get the best results. After you get into Python programming you must always remember the basics and stay away from making mistakes. This is because most beginner programmers forget the fundamental concepts first. I hope now you got a feel of Pandas. I will keep updating articles in this blog regarding more important topics mentioned earlier in this blog and others.</h1>
